# Stock Market NIFTY 50 Index Prediction

This project aims to predict whether the stock market price will go up or down based on historical data using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The stock market is known for its volatility and unpredictability. Predicting whether the price of a stock will increase or decrease can be challenging, but it is essential for making informed investment decisions. This project leverages historical stock market data and machine learning models to predict the direction of stock prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical stock market data, including features such as opening price, closing price, high price, low price, trading volume, total number of shares traded. Each data point represents the stock market activity

## Approach

The project follows these main steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain historical stock market data from nseindia.com.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering if necessary. Convert the target variable (stock price) into a binary classification problem (up or down).

3. **Feature Selection/Engineering**: Select relevant features and engineer new features that might improve model performance.

4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for binary classification tasks. Popular choices include Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting models (XGBoost, LightGBM).

5. **Model Training**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the selected models on the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of trained models using hyper parameter training.

7. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model(s) into production for real-time predictions or integrate them into an application.
